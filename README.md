## Code Quiz

### Description

The purpose of this project was to create a quiz that tested coding fundamentals. The structure within the quiz included a timer, multiple choice questions, a total score,  and a highscores list for every quiz score recorded. During the quiz, the user is asked five questions about coding for a total time of 75 seconds. If the user answers incorrectly then the time will shave off 10 seconds but if the user answers correctly, 10 seconds will be added back on. The quiz ends when the timer reaches 0 or all of the questions have been answered. The user is then prompted to record their score with their initials and have it saved in a highscores list.
